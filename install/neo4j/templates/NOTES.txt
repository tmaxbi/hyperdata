We'll need to wait a few seconds for Neo4j to start.

We need to see this line in our pod log:

> Remote interface available at Remote interface available at http://localhost:7474/

We can see the content of the logs by running the following command:

kubectl logs -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=={{ template "neo4j.name" . }}"
