**Anything else we need to know**:

Here are some information that help troubleshooting:

* if relevant, provide your `values.yaml` or the changes made to the default one (after removing sensitive information)
* the output of the folowing commands:

Check if a pod is in error: 
```bash
kubectl get pod
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
myrelease-nifi-0             3/4     Failed   1          56m
myrelease-nifi-registry-0    1/1     Running   0          56m
myrelease-nifi-zookeeper-0   1/1     Running   0          56m
myrelease-nifi-zookeeper-1   1/1     Running   0          56m
myrelease-nifi-zookeeper-2   1/1     Running   0          56m
```

Inspect the pod, check the "Events" section at the end for anything suspicious.

```bash
kubectl describe pod myrelease-nifi-0
```

Get logs on a failed container inside the pod (here the `server` one):

```bash
kubectl logs myrelease-nifi-0 server
```
